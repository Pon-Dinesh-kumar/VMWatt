## 🧩 Problem Statement
In the realm of energy monitoring and reporting, several critical challenges persist:
- **Lack of Accurate Hardware-Level Monitoring**: Current systems often struggle to provide the necessary precision for individual VMs.
- **Limitations of Guest Operating Systems**: Aggregating and reporting energy usage across the entire VM is complex.
- **Unifying Energy Monitoring and Reporting Solution**: Developing a unified solution capable of providing detailed insights into energy consumption.

## 💡 Motivation
My motivation stems from the pressing demand to enhance resource efficiency, reduce operational costs, and embrace environmental sustainability in data centers and cloud environments. I aim to create a versatile and precise tool that empowers organizations to make well-informed decisions regarding their energy consumption.

## 🎯 Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are:
- **Precise Power Consumption Calculation**: Develop a computational engine that accurately calculates the power consumption of both the host server and individual guest VMs.
- **Intuitive GUI Interface**: Create a user-friendly graphical interface for easy input of initialization details for the host and guest VMs.
- **Real-Time Meter Visualizations**: Implement a graphical representation module that provides real-time visual displays of power consumption.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
- **CloudSim Plus**: Java 17 simulation framework for Cloud computing modeling.
- **Medusa**: Gauge library for JavaFX to create visually appealing and interactive gauges and displays.
- **OpenJFX (JavaFX)**: Framework for building rich client applications using Java.
- **Maven**: Project management and build automation tool.

## 🧠 Main Logic Explanation
The application uses CloudSim Plus for simulation purposes. The main components of CloudSim Plus are:
- **Datacentre**: Represents a location of cloud infrastructure with its VMs and hosts.
- **Hosts**: Physical machines or servers in the datacentre that run multiple VMs.
- **Virtual Machines (VMs)**: Virtualized computing instances that run on hosts.
- **Cloudlets**: User-defined tasks executed in a cloud environment.
- **Brokers**: Intermediaries between the cloud user and the datacentre.

## 💻 Code Explanation
**Main.java**
```java
package com.yourpackage;

import javafx.application.Application;
import javafx.stage.Stage;

public class Main extends Application {
    @Override
    public void start(Stage primaryStage) {
        // Load the main FXML file and set the scene
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        launch(args);
    }
}
```

**SimulationController.java**
```java
package com.yourpackage.controllers;

import org.cloudbus.cloudsim.cloudlets.Cloudlet;
import org.cloudbus.cloudsim.vms.Vm;

public class SimulationController {
    public void runSimulation() {
        // Setup and run the CloudSim Plus simulation
    }
}
```

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- **Enhanced Data Visualization**: Integrate more advanced data visualization tools for better insights.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Use machine learning algorithms for predictive analysis of energy consumption.
- **Cloud Integration**: Extend the tool to support cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and GCP.
